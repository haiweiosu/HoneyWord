#Description: 
In this homework, we can trying to design algorithm to generate honeyword based on difference cases of original passwords. 
Particularly, there are 3 cases we considered. 
First: The training set T is empty, i.e. there are no given example password
Second: T is the set of the 100 most common RockYou passwords
Third: T is the full RockYou dataset.

#Goal: 
The goal for honeyword generator is to decrease the guessing probability of attackers. Ideally, the guessing probability is 1/n where n is number of sweetwords in the set.
